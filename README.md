# :movie_camera:	 Movie-Recommender-Genres-Keywords :film_projector:
Recommends movies based on the genre and keywords. 

This movie recommender system suggests identical movies to the user input. The movie recommender was uploaded to the Streamlit website containing a content-based algorithm. The website provides the user with a table of movie titles, similar to the user input. To summarize the technical functionality, user input is inserted in the cosine similarity method that measures the relationship of every movie. Then, the results are sorted from highest to lowest and displayed on the table and other graphs.
